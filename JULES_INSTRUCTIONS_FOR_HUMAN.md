# Jules AI Instructions - Dr. Islam Website Enhancement

## üéØ Project Overview
We're enhancing the Dr. Islam dental website by applying Herrington theme's professional design patterns while keeping the existing brand identity and architecture.

## üé® CRITICAL: Keep Existing Brand Colors
**DO NOT change the brand colors!** The Dr. Islam brand uses these specific colors:
- **Primary Gold**: `#BEB093` (the main brand color)
- **Secondary Gold**: `#D4C5A3` (lighter variation)
- **Accent Dark**: `#8B7F6B` (darker variation)

These colors are already throughout the website and must be preserved.

## üìã Task 1: Professional Service Cards (PRIORITY 1)

### What Jules Should Do:
Create a professional services section using the existing brand colors and Herrington's card design patterns.

### Files to Work With:
- **Main file**: `src/templates/en/sections/services.js`
- **CSS file**: `src/content/css/components.css.js` 
- **Reference**: `src/components/herrington-medical/MedicalServiceCard.js` (for inspiration)

### Specific Instructions for Jules:

**"Create a professional dental services section with 6 service cards. Use the existing Dr. Islam brand colors (#BEB093 primary, #D4C5A3 secondary) instead of creating new colors. 

The 6 services should be:
1. General Dentistry (ü¶∑) - Regular checkups and cleanings
2. Cosmetic Dentistry (‚ú®) - Smile makeovers and whitening
3. Dental Implants (üîß) - Tooth replacement solutions
4. Emergency Care (üö®) - 24/7 urgent dental care
5. Orthodontics (üòÅ) - Braces and teeth straightening
6. Pediatric Dentistry (üë∂) - Children's dental care

Each card needs:
- Service icon and title
- Brief description (2-3 sentences)
- 3-4 key features as bullet points
- 'Learn More' button using existing brand colors
- Hover animation (subtle lift effect)
- Mobile-responsive design

Make sure it works on mobile (375px), tablet (768px), and desktop (1200px). Test with both English and Arabic (?lang=ar) versions."**

### Expected Result:
A professional services grid that looks premium but uses the existing Dr. Islam colors and maintains the current website architecture.

Make it work on all device sizes and maintain the existing website performance."**
