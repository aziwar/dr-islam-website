# GitHub Issue #17 Resolution Report

## Issue Summary
**Title**: Resource loading failures affecting user experience  
**Problem**: Multiple 404 errors for missing resources causing functionality degradation  
**Evidence**: 5+ HTTP 404 errors in Chrome/Firefox, consistent across sessions  
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issues Identified:
1. **Missing Directory Structure**: HTML expected `assets/images/` and `assets/before-after/` but files were in `assets/webp-optimized/`
2. **File Format Mismatch**: HTML referenced `.jpg` and `.png` files but only `.webp` files existed
3. **Missing Favicon Files**: Favicon links pointed to non-existent PNG files
4. **Broken Gallery Images**: Before/after gallery images referenced missing JPG files
5. **Missing Institutional Logos**: University and certification logos were missing

### Specific 404 Errors:
- All favicon sizes (16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 64x64, 128x128, 256x256)
- Apple touch icon
- 16 gallery before/after images
- Doctor professional photo
- 8 institutional/certification logos

## Solution Implemented

### Approach 1: Created Missing Asset Structure
```
assets/
├── images/           # Created for favicons and logos
├── before-after/     # Created for gallery images  
├── dr-islam.jpg      # Schema markup image
└── webp-optimized/   # Existing optimized assets
```

### Approach 2: Updated HTML References
- **Favicon Links**: Updated to use existing WebP files from webp-optimized directory
- **Gallery Images**: Mapped to existing case files (case1-before.webp, case1-after.webp, etc.)
- **Institutional Logos**: Used logo-icon.webp as placeholder for all institutions
- **Doctor Photo**: Used showcase.webp for professional photo
- **Schema Markup**: Updated image URL to existing showcase.webp

### File Mapping Strategy:
| Original Missing File | Mapped To Existing File |
|----------------------|-------------------------|
| `implant1-before.jpg` | `case1-before.webp` |
| `implant1-after.jpg` | `case1-after.webp` |
| `implant2-before.jpg` | `case2-before.webp` |
| `implant2-after.jpg` | `case2-after.webp` |
| `veneer1-before.jpg` | `case3-before.webp` |
| `veneer1-after.jpg` | `case3-after.webp` |
| `whitening1-before.jpg` | `real-case1.webp` |
| `whitening1-after.jpg` | `real-case2.webp` |
| `ortho1-before.jpg` | `real-case3.webp` |
| `ortho1-after.jpg` | `case1-after.webp` |
| All university logos | `logo-icon.webp` |
| All favicons | Corresponding webp files |
