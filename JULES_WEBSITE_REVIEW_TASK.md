- Take screenshots of issues for documentation
- Document if issues are environment-specific or code-related

### Report Generation:
- Create detailed GitHub issue for each major problem found
- Use clear, actionable descriptions
- Include specific file paths and line numbers when possible
- Prioritize issues based on impact and effort to fix
