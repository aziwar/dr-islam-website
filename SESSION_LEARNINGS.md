# Session Summary: Python Tools for AI Limitations

## Core Concept
Create Python tools that act as bridges between AI limitations and user needs.

## Tools Created
1. **smart_logo_extractor.py** - AI-powered background removal
2. **simple_logo_extractor.py** - Color-based removal
3. **logo_extractor_gui.py** - GUI interface (needs fix)

## Key Pattern
When AI can't: Extract images, access files, run processes
Python can: Process locally, create GUIs, automate tasks

## Fix for GUI Issue
Missing dependency: onnxruntime (installed)
Possible issue: rembg downloading model on first run

## Desktop Commander Capabilities
- Install packages: `pip install`
- Run scripts: `python script.py`
- Create/edit files
- Execute commands

## Next Steps
1. Test with simpler image first
2. Add error logging to GUI
3. Consider web-based alternative
