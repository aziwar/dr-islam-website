# Issue #1: Create Missing README.md

## 🎯 Task: Create Project README.md

### 📋 Context
The dr-islam-website project currently lacks a main README.md file in the root directory. This is a critical documentation gap that makes it difficult for new developers to understand the project structure, setup process, and deployment workflow.

### ✅ Requirements
- [ ] Create README.md in project root
- [ ] Include comprehensive project overview
- [ ] Add local development setup instructions
- [ ] Document the deployment process
- [ ] Include architecture diagram (ASCII or Mermaid)
- [ ] Add contribution guidelines
- [ ] Include tech stack badges

### 💻 Technical Details
Use information from these existing files:
- `docs/project/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` - Business context and technical stack
- `DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md` - Deployment details
- `package.json` - Available scripts
- `wrangler.toml` - Cloudflare configuration

**README Structure:**
```markdown
# Dr. Islam Elsagher Dental Clinic Website
