## Brand Identity Preservation (CRITICAL)
**Existing Dr. Islam Brand Colors (NEVER CHANGE):**
- Primary Gold: `#BEB093` (main brand color)

- Accent Dark: `#8B7F6B` (darker variation)

**Architecture Constraints:**
- Platform: Cloudflare Workers (edge computing)
- Languages: Vanilla JavaScript + CSS-in-JS
- CSS Structure: `core.css.js → components.css.js → enhancements.css.js`
- Dual Language: English/Arabic with RTL support
- Performance: <2s load time requirement
- Responsive: 375px, 768px, 1200px breakpoints
