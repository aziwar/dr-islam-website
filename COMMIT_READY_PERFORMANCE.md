npm run dev
# In another terminal:
bash test-performance-monitoring.sh
# Check console output in dev terminal

# 2. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement comprehensive performance monitoring"
git push origin master

# 3. Enable Workers Analytics
# Dashboard > Workers & Pages > dr-islam-website > Analytics

```

## VERIFICATION:
After deployment:
1. Enable Workers Analytics in Cloudflare dashboard
2. Make test requests to production
3. View logs in Analytics > Real-time Logs
4. Filter by operation type
5. Check 95th percentile durations

## EXPECTED DURATIONS:
- Static files: <5ms
- CSS: <10ms  
- HTML: <5ms
- R2 images: 30-50ms
- GitHub fallback: 100-150ms
