# üö® CRITICAL UPDATE: UNCOMMITTED CHANGES

## PROBLEM IDENTIFIED
The cache headers and performance monitoring features are **implemented but NOT committed to Git**.

## EVIDENCE
1. **Git Status:** 5 modified files, 15 untracked files
2. **Git Log:** No commits for these features
3. **Local Files:** Features exist in src/index.js
4. **Production:** Features missing (no deployment occurred)

## SOLUTION: COMMIT AND DEPLOY NOW

```bash
# 1. Stage all changes
git add .

# 2. Commit with comprehensive message
git commit -m "feat: implement cache headers and performance monitoring

- Add getCacheHeaders() helper with s-maxage for CDN optimization
- Implement request-level performance tracking with timing metrics
- Track all operations: images, HTML, CSS, manifests, etc.
- Ready for Workers Analytics integration
- Created comprehensive test suite

Cache strategy:
- HTML: 1h client, 24h CDN (s-maxage=86400)
- CSS: 5m client, 1h CDN (s-maxage=3600)
- Static assets: 1y immutable
- Dynamic content: appropriate s-maxage values

Performance monitoring:
- Start/end timing for all requests
- Operation-specific metrics
- R2 vs GitHub fallback tracking
- Console logging for Workers Analytics"

# 3. Push to trigger auto-deploy
git push origin master
```

## WHY THIS HAPPENED
- Features were developed and tested locally ‚úÖ
- Test scripts confirmed working ‚úÖ
- Documentation was created ‚úÖ
- **BUT: Changes never committed to Git** ‚ùå

## DEPLOYMENT WILL OCCUR WHEN
1. Changes are committed
2. Pushed to master branch
3. GitHub Actions triggers
4. Cloudflare Workers updates (~2-3 minutes)

**ACTION REQUIRED:** Run the git commands above immediately.
