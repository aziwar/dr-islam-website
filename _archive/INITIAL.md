# Test Infrastructure Implementation

## Problem
Package.json references comprehensive test suites that don't exist, creating a critical gap in quality assurance and blocking proper CI/CD implementation.

## Current State
- Package.json defines 5 test scripts
- Only 1 test file exists (admin-auth.test.js)
- Missing: integration, performance, accessibility, mobile tests
- CI/CD cannot validate changes properly

## Requirements
1. **Integration Tests**
   - Gallery API endpoints validation
   - Routing logic verification
   - Form submission testing

2. **Performance Tests**
   - Lighthouse score maintenance (95+)
   - Core Web Vitals monitoring
   - Bundle size checks

3. **Accessibility Tests**  
   - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - Keyboard navigation

4. **Mobile Tests**
   - Touch target validation (48px minimum)
   - Gesture functionality
   - Responsive behavior

## Success Criteria
- All npm test scripts functional
- 80%+ code coverage
- Tests complete in <30 seconds
- Clear pass/fail reporting
- CI/CD integration ready

## Reference
- Existing pattern: tests/security/admin-auth.test.js
- Framework: Vitest + Playwright
