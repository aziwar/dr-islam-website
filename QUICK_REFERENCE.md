# ðŸš€ DR-ISLAM-WEBSITE QUICK REFERENCE

## Daily Commands
```powershell
npm start          # Opens menu
npm run dev        # Local development
npm run test:mobile # Test all viewports
npm run deploy:prod # Production deploy
```

## Golden Rules
1. **ALWAYS** test mobile first (375px)
2. **NEVER** deploy without npm run deploy:prod
3. **IGNORE** "quick fix" temptations
4. **TRUST** the automated workflow

## Problem â†’ Solution
- CSS not updating? â†’ BUILD_VERSION handles it
- Mobile broken? â†’ test:mobile catches it
- Deployment failed? â†’ deploy.ps1 validates first
- Site down? â†’ monitor.js alerts in 5 min

## Emergency Fixes
```powershell
# Force cache clear
npm run deploy:prod  # Includes cache bust

# Check what's deployed
wrangler deployments list

# View live logs
wrangler tail
```

## Remember
Your old workflow: Dev â†’ Deploy â†’ Debug â†’ Fix
Your new workflow: Dev â†’ Test â†’ Validate â†’ Deploy âœ“
