# Cloudflare Workers Image Hosting Options

Since Cloudflare Workers can't directly serve image files, here are your options:

## Option 1: Cloudflare Images (Recommended)
1. Upload images to Cloudflare Images
2. Get the image URLs
3. Update the HTML to use those URLs

## Option 2: External CDN
1. Upload to a service like:
   - Imgur
   - ImgBB  
   - Cloudinary
2. Use the direct image URLs

## Option 3: Base64 Encoding
1. Convert small logos to Base64
2. Embed directly in CSS/HTML
3. Good for logos under 10KB

## Option 4: GitHub Raw URLs
1. After uploading to GitHub
2. Use raw.githubusercontent.com URLs
3. Example: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aziwar/dr-islam-website/master/assets/images/logo-main.png

## Quick Solution:
For now, after you upload the images to GitHub, I can update the code to use the GitHub raw URLs automatically!
