# JULES: Sandbox Environment Testing Commands

## üèóÔ∏è Pre-Testing Setup Commands

**Jules: Execute these commands in your sandbox environment before browser testing:**

### 1. Project Setup & Dependencies
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd dr-islam-website

# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Check for any missing dependencies
npm audit --omit=dev
```

### 2. Development Server Startup
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Wait for server to be ready - should show:
# "Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8787"
# "Ready to serve requests"
```

### 3. Server Health Check
```bash
# Test if server responds (run in another terminal)
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://127.0.0.1:8787
# Should return: 200

# Check for any startup errors
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8787 | head -20
# Should return valid HTML
```

## üß™ Browser Testing Workflow

### Step 1: Environment Validation
1. **Verify server is running**: http://127.0.0.1:8787 loads properly
